Project Description:
This project tries to solve the problems patients face in managing their health information across multiple platforms and providers. Fragmentation in healthcare leads to inefficiencies such as repeated testing, misunderstandings, and treatment delays, impacting health outcomes. The project will, therefore, develop an integrated solution that will streamline communication between healthcare professionals and empower patients with a centralized system to manage appointments, prescriptions, and health metrics. The program focuses on improving care coordination, reducing redundancies, and generally enhancing the outcome for the patient.
